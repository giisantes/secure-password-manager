## Questions:

- How do password managers work?
- What hashing function to use?

## Project Workflow

This project uses a Kanban board to track development progress for the MVP of the Secure Password Manager.

### User Stories
All MVP features are tracked as GitHub Issues. Each issue includes:
- A clear user story
- Acceptance criteria
- Labels for filtering (`data access`, `feature`, `security`, etc.)

### Sprint Planning
Currently working through two sprints:
- **Sprint 1**: Authentication, encryption, and database setup
- **Sprint 2**: Credential management (Add, Edit, Retrieve, Delete)
